To embed images into the resources.py file:

cd src\
del resources.py
img2py -m #ffffff    ..\images\crosshair.png resources.py
img2py -m #ffffff -a ..\images\movestage.png resources.py
img2py            -a ..\images\tomo.ico resources.py

Note that the PNGs that are to be used as bitmaps for the tool bar should NOT have an alpha channel and have to use the -m #ffffff option.
This is to ensure that they end up being wx.bitmap objects that are 24 bit/pixel with wx.mask, instead of 32 bit/pixel without wx.mask.
The former kind of image will yield toolbar buttons that are automatically grayed out when disabled, whereas the latter
kind of images are not grayed out at all.
(In Gimp: background pixels must be opaque white, all pixels have 100% opacity. Then export to PNG,
with "Save background color" and "Save color values from transparent pixels" both unchecked.)
