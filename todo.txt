Work in progress
----------------

- Add (optional) extra EM "pyramid level" (after EM acquisition at e.g. 5000x magnification, register those images as well,
  and use registration offset and rotation as additional fine correction of stage position. Then acquire EM images at e.g. 15000x magnification.

To do
-----

- FIX inconsistency: after loading a poi_info.json file, the user can switch to the poi panel and change the number of sections.
  This will reduce all_points_of_interest, but what to do with combined_offsets_microns (used for EM acquisition)?
  See tomo/src/point_of_interest_panel.py.
  Also (after loading a POI? after doing this change?), EM acquisition is (again? still?) disabled in the menu. This is not correct.

- Add ability to pause/resume/stop image acquisition. See experiments/em_image_acquisition_demo.py
