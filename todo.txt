TODOs for Tomo
==============
- Add ability to pause/resume/stop image acquisition. See experiments/em_image_acquisition_demo.py

- Add (optional) extra EM "pyramid level" (after EM acquisition at e.g. 5000x maginification, register those images as well,
  and use registration offset and rotation as additional fine correction of stage position. Then acquire EM images at e.g. 15000x magnification.

- Add ability to acquire *multiple* ROIs in LM, then vent the microscope, and then acquire the corresponding ROIs in EM.
  This may be implemented perhaps by saving ROI position + SIFT registration transformation info (or only the offsets) to disk,
  and read it back from disk for EM image acquisition.

- Allow optional specification of ROI that acquired images will be cropped to before running SIFT registration.
  (To help SIFT focus on relevant portion of the images. This is a hack/workaround for failing SIFT registrations.)
  Currently that ROI is hard-coded in model.py and sift_registration.py.
  Additionally also allow contrast enhancement? Does Sergio's attempt work in headless mode?
