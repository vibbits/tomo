Work in progress
----------------


To do
-----

- Disable the LM camera before starting EM image acquisition.
  In Odemis this means that the button "OPTICAL" needs to be disabled (so it should be gray, not orange).
  See tab_data.opticalState.
  Can we change its state from outside Odemis? Perhaps too deep in Odemis to be accessed externally.

- FIX inconsistency: after loading a poi_info.json file, the user can switch to the poi panel and change the number of sections.
  This will reduce all_points_of_interest, but what to do with combined_offsets_microns (used for EM acquisition)?
  See tomo/src/point_of_interest_panel.py.
  More generally, it would be nice to have the ability to image subsets of sample slices (to quickly try something out
  or confirm that it works before spending tens of minutes to acquire images for all slices).

Nice to have
------------
- Add ability to pause/resume/stop image acquisition? See experiments/em_image_acquisition_demo.py
  (So the user can check that acquisition if going fine?)

- Perhaps remember last file location of the POI json file?
