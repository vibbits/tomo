To do
-----

- Add ability to pause/resume/stop image acquisition. See experiments/em_image_acquisition_demo.py

- Add (optional) extra EM "pyramid level" (after EM acquisition at e.g. 5000x magnification, register those images as well,
  and use registration offset and rotation as additional fine correction of stage position. Then acquire EM images at e.g. 15000x magnification.
